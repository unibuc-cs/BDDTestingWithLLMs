# BDDTestingWithLLMs
This is the respository of the paper "Agentic AI for Behavior-Driven Development Testing using Large Language Models" by Ciprian Paduraru, Miruna Zavelca, Alin Stefanescu, accepted at ICAART 2025. 

Notes:
- There are two notebooks, Play and Play2 to demo the features implemented.
- A general framework for LLMs is in local folder LLM, while specifics for the BDD writing assistant are in the three BDD_*.py files in the main folder.
- The Data folder and car-behave-master are public data used to demo and fine-tune as example.
- The model checkpoint is saved in LLM/outputs
